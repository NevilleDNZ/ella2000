The ELLA prover has been developed to aid the verification of hardware designs
and it is being made available to the public for study purposes. It takes a 
subset of the hardware design language ELLA as the design input and contains 
additional syntax for inputting statements about how the design is thought to behave. These statements can be manipulated in an effort to prove them correct.

The ELLA Prover and documentation consists of the following files :-

prover		   the executable code

prover.init	   an initialisation file needed by prover

graphics.help	   the help file for the graphical version of the prover  

non_graphics.help  the help file for the non-graphical version of the prover	

EPManual.ps	   a postscript file of the ELLA Prover User Manual

EPSubset.ps	   a postscript file of the ELLA Prover Subset - the subset of
		   ELLA used for the prover


To start the prover
-------------------

To start the prover on a Sun running UNIX, with OpenWindows for the graphical
mode, use one of the following commands.

For graphical mode use the command :-

<pathname>prover \
"DIAGFILE=<pathname>prover.log" "INITFILE=<pathname>prover.init" \
"PROVER_HELP=<pathname>graphics.help" "FLAGS=fftffttff"

For non-graphical mode use the command :-

<pathname>prover \
"DIAGFILE=<pathname>prover.log" "INITFILE=<pathname>prover.init" \
"PROVER_HELP=<pathname>non_graphics.help" "FLAGS=fftffttft"

If a pathname is omitted the current directory is assumed. The first parameter
names a log file which can be re-run to repeat a session. The second and third
parameters indicate where to find the initialisation and help files. The fourth
parameter sets nine constants, the last of which indicates if the graphical or
non-graphical version of the prover is to be started.
